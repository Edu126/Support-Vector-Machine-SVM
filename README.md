# Support Vector Machine(SVM) - Model Implementation
**Definition**
> Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Its primary objective is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (where N is the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points into different classes.

> In simple terms, SVM draws the best line (hyperplane) on the ground to separate instances in a group, creating a big gap between them. Kernels, like Picasso armed with a super calculator, help SVM use interesting shapes to achieve this, making it smart in distinguishing unique features and deciding who's who.
And Reggresion? Well, Imagine that instead of deviding your data, you want to know where the hyperplane will go and analize its trend.

**About the dataset**:

> The dataset contains gene expression of various leukemia patients and contains
gene expression of various leukemia patients on 39 selected locations of the human
genome. These genome positions refer to the genes NPM1, RUNX1, HOXA1, . . .,
HOXA11, HOXA13. These genes are commonly known to be relevant for leukemia.
This genomic data is the basis on which doctors obtain their diagnosis of whether a
patient has leukemia.

This is a curated dataset so no major data transformation are required.


**Task**:

> Build an SVM classifier that decides for each patient whether or not
they have blood cancer




Notes: No Cross validation or Hyperparameters Optimization is made for the intial porpuse of the notebook.
